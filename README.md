Description:
This program is an app designed to help track and improve spending habits for increased independence and economic freedom of its users. The program will have a main screen with some basic data on it like how much their monthly budget it, how much the user has spent, and what percentage has been spent. Then there will be an expandable widget which will allow you to add an expense for a meal (can tag to breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack), routine payments, groceries, gifts, automobile care, and others. The program will take in categorized daily expenditures and monthly/yearly monetary goals from the user.
